</p>
<p>
Your usage of the FixUp mobile application or submission of service requests via our mobile application or website constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices in effect at such time.

If you have any questions regarding these Terms & Conditions, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@tryfixup.com">info@tryFixUp.com</a>. We may amend these Terms & Conditions at any time by issuing a revised version of these Terms and Conditions on the FixUp Website, at <a href="http://www.tryfixup.com">www.tryFixUp.com</a>. These Terms & Conditions were last updated on 12/7/2012.

</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>FIXUP LOGIN.</strong> Upon your registration, you must choose your own password, which should be kept confidential, and used to access the FixUp services through the FixUp Web site.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>FIXUP SERVICES.</strong> At FixUp we are committed to making your total FixUp experience a positive one. Upon searching our network of service providers, we will provide you with a list of service providers in your area, if any, who may be interested in fulfilling your service need. You can also have the opportunity to read service provider reviews, watch service provide intro videos and other features which can assist in your selection.</p>
	<p>
	We do not guarantee that we will be able to match your service needs with a service provider or that there are service providers in your area that are either capable or willing to complete your service needs. Although we take certain steps to examine the credentials of our listed service providers, we make no guarantees or representations regarding the skills or representations of such service providers or the quality of the job that he or she may perform for you if you elect to retain their services. FixUp may inform you of certain offers or discounts provided by a service provider. Such offers or discounts are made solely by the service provider, and FixUp does not guarantee or warrant the pricing or discounts that a service provider may offer you. Any quotes provided by Service Providers via the FixUp website are not contractually binding offers, are for informational purposes only, and cannot be accepted on or via the FixUp website. No contractual arrangement is created based upon the quotes provided to you from Service Providers (or your scheduling of an appointment with a Service Provider) via the FixUp website. To contract with a Service Provider, you must work directly with the Service Provider. FixUp does not endorse or recommend the services of any particular service provider. It is entirely up to you to enter into a direct contract or otherwise reach agreement with a service provider, and we do not guarantee or warrant their performance on the job or the outcome or quality of the services performed. The service providers are not employees or agents of FixUp, nor is FixUp an agent of the service providers. FixUp does not perform, and is not responsible for, any of the services requested by you in your service request. Your rights under contracts you enter into with service providers are governed by the terms of such contracts and by applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. Should you have a dispute with any service provider, you must address such dispute with the service provider directly, AND YOU HEREBY AGREE TO RELEASE FIXUP AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) AND ANY OTHER PERSON, FIRM, OR ENTITY (INCLUDING OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS SUCH AS A PRODUCT MANUFACTURER OR DEVELOPER WHO DEVELOPS THE FIXUP APPLICATION) FROM ANY DAMAGES OR CLAIMS (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES) OF EVERY KIND OR NATURE, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, AND DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES AND YOUR DEALINGS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.


	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>RESOLUTION PROCESS AND LIMITED SERVICE GUARANTEE.</strong> FixUp cannot guarantee the 
work performed by a listed service provider, and has no obligation to you with regard to your relationship with a service provider- a relationship which may arise in the course of an improvement repair or maintenance project and which may be the fault of a service provider who you learned about through the FixUp services and applications. Although we have no such obligation, we may, upon your request, provide limited assistance in resolving disputes between you and a service provider. You must participate and use good faith efforts to resolve problems through the FixUp resolution process. If, in its sole discretion, FixUp determines that you have not participated and cooperated in good faith in the resolution process, FixUp may terminate such Resolution Process. Such limited assistance in no way nullifies the release and indemnification described in these Terms & Conditions.
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US.</strong> Upon using the FixUp services, you will be prompted to disclose certain information about yourself and your service requirements, and you will be able to store information, such as home services records, on our Web site. Some of this information will be sent to service providers who will need this information to respond to you or to other persons or entities in connection with our business. By providing this information to us, or by submitting a service request using our application, you are requesting, and you expressly consent to being contacted by us and by our service providers via phone, fax, email, push notification, mail or other reasonable means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, even if you are listed on any federal, state, provincial or other applicable "Do Not Call" list, in order that we may provide the services set forth on our site, to service your account, to reasonably address matters pertaining to your account or for other purposes reasonably related to your service request and our business, including marketing related emails. For complete details on our use of your information, please see our privacy statement. You agree that by completing a service request, you are entering into a business relationship with FixUp and its partners and thus agree to be contacted by FixUp and/or its partners or network of service providers.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<strong>SERVICE PROVIDER PRESCREENING PROCEDURES AND DISCLAIMERS.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>
Licensing</strong> - FixUp makes a reasonable attempt at the time of a service provider’s registration, that a prospective new service provider member has all applicable required <strong>state-level</strong> trade licensing. Certain states may require state-level licensing for projects above specified dollar amounts. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements with the business and the applicable state and local licensing authorities. In some states, licensing may be required by the county or local authority in which the work is being performed. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding with your project. Larger projects often require the use of sub-contractors for specific types of work (for example, a kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We recommend you verify that all the sub-contractors doing work on your project carry the appropriate licensing. Given the unique nature of California licensing, FixUp relies on representations of service providers that are using a California General building contracting license to cover home improvement tasks, that such service providers are performing more than one task as defined and required by California licensing rules. We always recommend that you ask the business to provide you with a copy of their license.
	</p>
	<p>
	

<strong>NOTE:</strong> FixUp performs screening solely at the time the service provider applies for membership in the FixUp network, and therefore a service provider's information may change or expire over time. Thus, FixUp cannot and does not warrant or represent that profile and screening information is up to date. FixUp is under no obligation to update a service provider's screening information. We recommend that before working with a service provider you verify that information presented in the service provider's profile, including any applicable state-level license, is still accurate, current and/or acceptable to you.

	</p>
	<p>
	
<strong>Service Providers Profiles:</strong> FixUp allows Service Providers to post profiles, including intro videos and descriptions about themselves and their business on the FixUp mobile application. FixUp does not review or verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles, except as expressly set forth above, as they are self-reported by the Service Provider. FixUp therefore makes no representations or warranties regarding any information posted by a Service Provider, and assumes no liability for such information.
	</p>
	<p>
The above procedures may change from time to time at the sole discretion of FixUp. FixUp believes that it uses commercially reasonable methods to check these matters but does not make any representations or warranties that members are appropriately licensed or free of significant state-level civil legal judgments, during the period they are members, or thereafter. As circumstances can change daily, FixUp advises consumers to check these matters for themselves especially at future dates. FixUp does not represent or warrant that the information received from state, provincial or other government agencies or from third party sources is accurate, error free, or that it is up to date or updated at the time that FixUp checks such information. Most agencies have periodic update cycles or schedules and this information is not updated on a real-time basis by such agencies and third party sources.
	</p>
	<p>
	

DISCLAIMER: FIXUP EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE PRESCREENING PROCESS, CRITERIA, PROCEDURES, OR INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PRESENTED IN THE PRESCREENING PROCESS OR DISCLOSURES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES OR STANDARDS ARE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IN THESE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IS ACCURATE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE.

	</p>
	<p>
	

<strong>Ratings & Reviews are not endorsed by FixUp</strong>
	<br />
	All Ratings and Reviews of a Service Provider displayed to you reflect the opinions of other consumers, and do not reflect or represent the opinions or representations of FixUp. FixUp disclaims any and all representations or warranties with regard to the Ratings and Reviews.

	<strong>ARTICLES AND OTHER CONTENT.</strong> FixUp provides certain content relating to home improvement, repair, maintenance ("Articles"), on the FixUp website, and via mobile applications owned and operated by FixUp. Such Articles are provided "As-Is", without any warranties or representations, and you assume all liability and responsibility for your use of such Articles. You understand and agree that the Articles do not provide advice, and that such Articles are no substitute for the advice of a provider.

	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>INDEMNIFICATION.</strong> YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY FIXUP, AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CO-BRANDERS, AND OTHER PARTNERS AND HOLD THEM EACH HARMLESS FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DEMANDS, INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY DUE TO OR ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE FIXUP SERVICES OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIXUP WEB SITE OR YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR ARISING FROM YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY.

	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>GENERAL PROVISIONS.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that the FixUp services are provided to you on an "AS IS" basis without any warranty whatsoever, and your sole and exclusive remedy, and FixUp's sole obligation to you or any third party for any claim arising out of your use of the FixUp services or the FixUp Web site or FixUp mobile applications, is that you are free to discontinue your use of the FixUp services or the FixUp Web site at any time. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, FIXUP EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT FIXUP SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFIT), EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (EVEN IF FIXUP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONSEQUENCES WHICH FLOW FROM IT. SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON OR EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN SUCH STATES AND PROVINCES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. The Terms and Conditions will inure to the benefit of FixUp's successors, assigns and licensees. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, for any reason, by any court of competent jurisdiction that provision shall be modified in order to make it enforceable, while maintaining the spirit of the provision. Alternatively, if modification is not possible, such provision shall be stricken and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms. The failure of FixUp to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the FixUp services or the Terms and Conditions must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely in the State of California and between California residents. You agree to submit to jurisdiction in California and that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions will be brought solely in a court in Los Angeles, California. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and FixUp and supersede all oral and written negotiations or representations of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and Conditions may not be modified or amended other than by an agreement signed by both parties.

The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. By associating an account managed by a third party with your FixUp account and authorizing FixUp to have access to this information, you agree that FixUp may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In order to help protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal information, we may collect information about your use and interaction with our website, application or the FixUp Services.

Also, if you request that we validate your status as a FixUp customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that service providers and service provider companies may have their own privacy policies, and FixUp may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.

<h2>  How you can access or change your personal information</h2>
<p>
Please email us if you would like to close your FixUp account, at <a href="mailto:info@tryfixup.com">info@tryFixUp.com</a>. If you close your FixUp account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
