				<div class="entry">
					<p>Well, we&#8217;ve all been working really hard over here at Start Up Minds to launch our latest app called FixUp.  In a nutshell, it&#8217;s disrupting the world of home and car repair &#8211; that means<span id="more-66"></span> appliances, plumbing issues, broken electronics, flat tires or anything at all.</p>
					<p>Instead of sending your product in or having a serviceman come over to your location and charge you $50 for an estimate,  you can now have a video conference call with that serviceman immediately and fix the issue yourself within minutes at a fraction of the cost.</p>
					<p>Our official press release is below, and we look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>
					<p><strong>________________</strong></p>
					<p>FixUp is the world&#8217;s first mobile application allowing users to instantly connect with a network of skilled service professionals through iPhone video. It is previewing at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt Conference in San Francisco on September 10, 2012.</p>
					<p>The application promises to help users &#8220;fix anything fast&#8221; by providing a marketplace to find reliable experts in service industry verticals such as plumbing, electrical, and automotive repair.  Currently in private beta, the iOS app is designed to eliminate the often times unnecessary, inconvenient, and overpriced house-calls required for minor home and car repairs. Replacing the in-person consultation visit with a quick and instant video conference, users are able to show experts exactly what is wrong and gain the necessary advice to solve their problems in the most efficient way possible, all for a reasonable per-minute rate. *Browse, Connect, Fix.</p>
					<p>FixUp experts can help users diagnose and fix problems like blown fuses, flat tires, clogged pipes, computer crashes, smoky chimneys and a lot more.  Available for free in the App Store, the application guides the user through a seamless experience available right at their fingertips.  All you need to do is browse our marketplace for qualified pre-screened professionals, instantly connect with them through the video feature of their iPhone, and fix your problem with a step by step instruction guided through a step by step process that will help them fix their problem. For problems that cannot be solved through the initial video consultation, FixUp facilitates an in-person visit with the chosen expert.  The price the user pays for that initial consultation is then deducted from the fixer’s house call flat rate.</p>
					<p>&#8220;In this day and age, people want quick resolutions to repairs around the house. FixUp is all about taking the hassle out of the daily household repairs and chores, by unleashing the power of the iPhone and video technology to do so,&#8221; says Co-Founder David Gonen.  &#8221;Our app allows consumers to figure out what exactly is wrong, fix it themselves if possible, and if not, get a real time quote with a pre-screened expert &#8211; 24 hours a day/7 days a week,&#8221; Gonen explains.</p>
					<p>FixUp is the perfect solution for consumers who are tired of overpriced repair fees, long wait times, and second visits due to missing parts.</p>
					<p><strong>About FixUp: </strong>FixUp is the world&#8217;s first skilled service marketplace that allows users to connect instantly to experts through iPhone video. Empowering consumers to fix anything fast, the iOS application is designed for users who need five minute consultations for five minute problems. Incubated by StartupMinds, a Los Angeles based accelerator, FixUp maintains offices on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, CA.
