<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
In an ideal world, we would automatically know how to fix something when it breaks, and it would be repaired at a moment's notice. In the real world, however, it's a time consuming and expensive process. The Do It Yourselfers spend hours Googling the solution&mdash;attempting to fix it through trial and error, while the rest of us call different contractors one by one until we get a hold of someone who MIGHT be able to come to the rescue. And even then, we often have to wait hours or days for an appointment so they could show up, diagnose the problem and charge us a service call fee.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
What if there was a way to get help immediately by connecting with a fixing coach who would guide you through the process step by step using the video feature of your iPhone? With the new FixUp app, this is all possible.
</p>
<p>
Once you click on the app, you're able to see which coaches are immediately available and view their rates, reviews and expertise. You then contact the best one for you, tell them your issue, and, utilizing the mobile video feature of your phone, you get walked through how to fix it (or at least identify what parts to get). The typical contractor's phrase, "Well, I need to come over and see it" is now eliminated because he or she is "seeing it" through the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
After the video consultation is over, your item is ideally fixed, and the contractor is automatically paid his per minute rate which you agreed to beforehand. No waiting for a return call. No waiting for someone to come to the house. It's all immediate and seamless. Instead of paying the $65 minimum service fee for the plumber to travel to your house just to diagnose the problem, you've only paid $14.00 (7 minutes &times; his $2/minute rate) for his time.
</p>
<p>
However, if for some reason, he cannot fix the issue over the phone, not to worry. Whatever you paid through your virtual Fixup session will be applied to the actual in person service call. If, for some reason, you decide not to use his services or he could not help you in any way via the phone, then you don't pay anything for the call.
