	<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>
Q: How much does FixUp cost?
<br />A: Fixers charge anywhere between $.25 to $5 per minute. The app is free to download.
</p>
<p>
Q: Where can I use this?
<br />A: Anywhere in the United States.
</p>
<p>
Q: How do I know that your fixers are legitimate?
<br />A: We prescreen all fixers. Our feedback system also allows clients to rate and review fixers, providing an extra layer of screening.
</p>
<p>
Q: Do I need Wi-Fi for this?
<br />A: No. FixUp works better on Wi-Fi, but it's not necessary.
</p>
<p>
Q: How is the video conferencing any different from FaceTime or Skype?
<br />A: Video is just one of FixUp's many tricks. We've got a database of hundreds of service providers, an automatic billing feature using Apple Store credits, embedded GPS, a cool flashlight feature&hellip;and the list goes on.
</p>
<p>
Q: Do I have to use video? What if I just want to talk to a fixer?
<br />A: You can turn off the video using a button on the app.
</p>
<p>
Q: What if the fixer can't help me?
<br />A: Your fixer can easily refund either 50% or 100% of your credits.
</p>
<p>
Q: How do I pay for FixUp?
<br />A: Apple Store credits. No credit cards necessary.
</p>
<p>
Q: I'm overwhelmed by the number of fixers you have. How can I tell which ones are closest to me, in the specialty I need?
<br />A: FixUp automatically sorts the fixers by how many miles they are from you. If you've previously used the service and selected favorites, it lists those fixers first.
</p>
<p>
Q: Can I use FixUp with my existing [plumber/electrician/handyman/etc.]?
<br />A: Yes, if your service provider has an Apple device. You can text the link to the app directly to your provider, or have us register your provider for you. (Email us at <a href="mailto:info@tryfixup.com">info@tryfixup.com</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Q: How do I know if the fixer I choose is available at the time I need the fix?
<br />A: FixUp displays the availability of each fixer.
</p>
<p>
Q: What if my fixer determines that my issue is beyond the scope of a video call?
<br />A: The fixer can stop by your house or office for a full in-person consultation. The amount you paid for the video call would be deducted from the cost of the in-person consultation.
</p>
<p>
Q: I'd like to use FixUp. How do I get started?
<br />A: Great! All you need to do is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fixup/id554846760?mt=8">download the FixUp app</a> onto your iPhone, iPod, or iPad and select a fixer.
</p>
<p>
Q: What about an Android version?
<br />A: Coming soon! Email us at <a href="mailto:info@tryfixup.com">info@tryfixup.com</a> to get notified once we launch for Android.
